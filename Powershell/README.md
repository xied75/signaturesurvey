Signature Survey (Powershell)
=============================

Use
---

Change the last line of the script to the folder you want to monitor.

``Monitor-SurveySignature "D:\Code\PathToProject"``



This is just a temporary way to run the signature survey. It should be something like ``@powershell SignatureSurvey.ps1 "D:\Code\PathToProject"`` outside of the script file.
